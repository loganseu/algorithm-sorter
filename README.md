## What is algorithm-sorter? 
algorithm-sorter is a Winforms application written using C# that visually represents various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, etc.). It was originally created as a learning tool to develop a better understanding of SYDE 223 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course concepts. The image below is a preview of the application:

### Built With
This application was built in a Windows environment using Visual Studio and .Net Framework (C#).


### Installation

1. If you haven't already installed Visual Studio, you can download it for free [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads)
2. Clone the repository using the method of your choice; I typically use Git Bash.
```
git clone https://github.com/loganseu/algorithm-sorter.git
```
3. Open the solution, and simply run the application by clicking "Start". You may do this in either debug or release mode.

## Usage

Play around with any of the settings; You're free to change sorting speeds, the number of sorting elements, the algorithm, etc. The window size is currently locked, as the bitmap image uses the number of pixels to calculate the width of each bar.
